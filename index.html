      <p> Wikipedia says:</p>
      <blockquote cite = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York-style_pizza"> <p> New Yorkâ€“style pizza is pizza made with a characteristically large hand-tossed thin crust, often sold in wide slices to go. The crust is thick and crisp only along its edge, yet soft, thin, and pliable enough beneath its toppings to be folded in half to eat. Traditional toppings are simply tomato sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese.</p> </blockquote>
